/**
 * <p>
 * Interface defining an individual in which all members of a collection are
 * declared pair-wise disjoint.  This allows ontologies that wish to support the
 * unique names assumption to add this condition in languages (like OWL) that
 * do not make the same assumption, with a minimum number of statements.
 * Instances of the all different axiom are expected to have a property
 * (e.g. <code>owl:distinctMembers</code> defining the list of distinct
 * individuals in the ontology.  For a given vocabulary, this will be defined by
 * the {@linkplain Profile#DISTINCT_MEMBERS distinctMembers} entry.
