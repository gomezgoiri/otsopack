 * <p>
 * Exception that is raised when an ontology operation is attempted that is
 * not present in the language profile for the current ontology model. For example,
 * if the language profile is
 * {@linkplain tesi.ontology.ProfileRegistry#OWL_LITE_LANG owl lite},
 * class complements are not permitted and so that element of the profile is null.
 * An attempt to create a class complement in an OWL Lite model will raise a
 * ProfileException.
