/**
 * <p>
 * Interface that represents the category of annotation properties in an ontology
 * language.  Annotation properties are distinguished in some languages (such as
 * OWL) - in order to maintain theoretical properties of the language, which depend
 * on clean separation of syntactic categories.  Annotation properties may not be
 * used in property expressions. There is no guarantee that a given langauge will
 * have any annotation properties.
