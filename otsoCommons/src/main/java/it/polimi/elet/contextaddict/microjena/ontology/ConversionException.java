 * Exception that is thrown when an ontology resource is converted to another
 * facet, using {@link tesi.rdf.model.RDFNode#as as()}, and the requested conversion is not
 * possible. The reasons for the failure may be that the requested term is not
 * in the language {@linkplain Profile profile} of the language attached to the
 * ontology model, or because the pre-conditions for the conversion are not met.
