/** An RDF Literal.
 * 
 * <p>In RDF2003 literals can be typed. If typed then the literal comprises a
 * datatype, a lexical form and a value (together with an optional xml:lang
 * string). Old style literals have no type and are termed "plain" literals.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Implementations of this interface should be able to support both plain
 * and typed literals. In the case of typed literals the primitive accessor methods 
 * such as getInt()  determine if the literal value can be coerced to an appropriate
 * java wrapper class. If so then the class is unwrapped to extract the primitive
 * value returned. If the coercion fails then a runtime DatatypeFormatException is 
 * thrown.</p>
 * 
 * <p>In the case of plain literals then the primitve accessor methods duplicate
 * the behvaiour of jena1. The literal is internally stored in lexical form but
 * the accessor methods such as getInt will attempt to parse the lexical form
 * and if successful will return the primitive value.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Object (i.e. non-primitive) values are supported. In the case of typed literals
 * then a global TypeMapper registry determines what datatype representation to
 * use for a given Object type. In the case of plain literals then the object
 * will be stored in the lexical form given by its <CODE>toString</CODE> method. 
 * Factory objects, provided by the application, are needed in that case to covert
 * the lexical form back into the appropriate object type.</p>
